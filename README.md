# Fetch API Examples

## What It Does
- Demonstrates how to fetch data from a mock API
- Utilizes vanilla JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements based on the fetched data

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Use the command line to navigate into the cloned project folder.
    ```bash
    cd [project-directory]
    ```
3. **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
    - Alternatively, you can use a local server to serve the project. I recommend the 'Live Server' extension by Ritwick Dey

## Usage
1. **Open the Webpage**: Navigate to the project in your browser.
2. **Interact with the UI**: The page will automatically fetch data from the mock API and display it.
3. **Check the Console**: Open the browser's developer console to see logs and debug.
